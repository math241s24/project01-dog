Districts with the lowest rates of adoption include 10-14. From this, we may conclude that geography plays a major role in pet adoption in the City of Dallas.\n\n## Q2, Those that Linger:\n\nTurning to our second query, we weighed the manner of intake which animals underwent against the duration of their stay in a shelter. This was done by constructing a measurement from the intake date to the outtake date (*dog_duration*), and charting it against *intake_type*.\n\nWe then generated three visualizations from which to glean trends.\n\n## Those that Linger (Cont'):\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](presentation_files/figure-revealjs/unnamed-chunk-2-1.png){width=960}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## Those that Linger (Cont') (Cont'):\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](presentation_files/figure-revealjs/unnamed-chunk-3-1.png){width=960}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## Those that Linger (Cont') (Cont') (Cont'):\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](presentation_files/figure-revealjs/unnamed-chunk-4-1.png){width=960}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## Those that Linger (Cont') (Cont') (Cont') (Cont'):\n\nObserving the data, we found that *Owner Surrender* and *Stray* were the two most common forms of intake. In terms of duration, intake via *Foster*, *Wildlife*, *Owner Surrender*, and *Stray* correlated with the briefest tenures in shelter care, with *Found* and *Lost Report* correlating with lengthier stays.\n\n## Thank you for Listening\n\nNow go out and adopt an animal, volunteer at a shelter, or just gift Adrien a shelter dog!\n\n![](data/An animal shelt 26c6ebca-c687-4492-a84a-370713f847d9.png)\n",
