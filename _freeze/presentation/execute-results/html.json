Districts with the lowest rates of adoption include 10-14. From this, we may conclude that geography plays a major role in pet adoption in the City of Dallas.\n\n## Dallas Adopters Club (Cont') (Cont') (Cont'):\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\nReading layer `Councils' from data source \n  `/Users/sydneystitt/Desktop/MATH241/project01-dog/data/Councils/Councils.shp' \n  using driver `ESRI Shapefile'\nSimple feature collection with 14 features and 6 fields\nGeometry type: POLYGON\nDimension:     XY\nBounding box:  xmin: 2430146 ymin: 6909399 xmax: 2592859 ymax: 7061339\nProjected CRS: NAD83 / Texas North Central (ftUS)\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](presentation_files/figure-revealjs/unnamed-chunk-2-1.png){width=960}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## Dallas Adopters Club (Cont') (Cont') (Cont') (Cont'):\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](presentation_files/figure-revealjs/unnamed-chunk-3-1.png){width=960}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## Q2, Those that Linger:\n\nTurning to our second query, we weighed the manner of intake which animals underwent against the duration of their stay in a shelter. This was done by constructing a measurement from the intake date to the outtake date (*dog_duration*), and charting it against *intake_type*.\n\nWe then generated three visualizations from which to glean trends.\n\n## Those that Linger (Cont'):\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n#Making a duration variable using dplyr\ndog_duration <- dog %>%\n   mutate(intake_date = mdy(intake_date),\n         outcome_date = mdy(outcome_date)) %>%\n  mutate(duration = difftime(outcome_date, intake_date, units = \"days\")) %>%\n  mutate(duration = as.vector(duration))\ndog_duration_summary <- dog_duration %>%\n  group_by(intake_type) %>%\n  summarize(average_duration = mean(duration, na.rm = TRUE),\n            sd_duration = sd(duration, na.rm = TRUE),\n            count_types = n()) \nprint(dog_duration_summary)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n# A tibble: 8 Ã— 4\n  intake_type     average_duration sd_duration count_types\n  <chr>                      <dbl>       <dbl>       <int>\n1 CONFISCATED                9.94         8.26        1633\n2 FOSTER                     1.86         3.95         492\n3 FOUND REPORT              12.4          9.21         420\n4 LOST REPORT               12.7          7.09         990\n5 OWNER SURRENDER            5.21         7.01        9612\n6 STRAY                      6.36         7.00       20890\n7 TRANSFER                   8.08         9.92          88\n8 WILDLIFE                   0.282        1.34         694\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## Those that Linger (Cont') (Cont'):\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](presentation_files/figure-revealjs/unnamed-chunk-5-1.png){width=960}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## Those that Linger (Cont') (Cont') (Cont'):\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](presentation_files/figure-revealjs/unnamed-chunk-6-1.png){width=960}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## Those that Linger (Cont') (Cont') (Cont') (Cont'):\n\nObserving the data, we found that *Owner Surrender* and *Stray* were the two most common forms of intake. In terms of duration, intake via *Foster*, *Wildlife*, *Owner Surrender*, and *Stray* correlated with the briefest tenures in shelter care, with *Found* and *Lost Report* correlating with lengthier stays. This may be because contacting owners for lost and found animals can be a lengthy process. Additionally, most wildlife animals end up euthanized.\n\n## Thank you for Listening\n\nNow go out and adopt an animal, volunteer at a shelter, or just gift Adrien a shelter dog\n\n![](data/An%20animal%20shelt%2026c6ebca-c687-4492-a84a-370713f847d9.png)\n",
