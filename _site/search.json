Each observation/row is an individual animal entered by staff into the shelter system. There are 34819 observations. The data is across all animal types including dogs, cats and other wildlife.\nWe chose this data set because we are dog lovers and one of our group members is from Dallas and volunteered at a local shelter. It also seemed to have well collected data with a lot of diversity within key variables like dog breed and intake form.\nVariables:\n1) Animal_id (ID number for each animals)\n2) Animal_type (dog, cat, wildlife)\n3) Animal_Breed\n4) Month (intake month)\n5) Month (intake Year)\n6) Census_tract (Geographical Location)\n7) Council_district (Geographical Boundries)\n8) Intake_type\n9) Outcome_type\n10) Outcome_date(When animals leave the shelter)\n11) Chip_status (is the animal chipped?)\n12) animal_origin (How they got the animal)\nDiscussion Questions\n\nWhich city council districts have the highest rate of adoption? (council_district and outcome_type).\n\nFilter outcome_type for observations only including adoptions using dplyr.\nQuantify how many observations of adoptions there are in each district.\nGraph using bar graph with ggplot2.\n\nWhat types of animal intake tend to stay longer in shelters?\n\nMutate new variable for duration of stay with dplyr\nGraph using bar graph with error bars for average stay (y axis) and type of intake (x axis) with ggplot2"

Districts with the lowest rates of adoption include 10-14. From this, we may conclude that geography plays a major role in pet adoption in the City of Dallas."
