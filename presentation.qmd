## Our Opening Spiel:

Data

-   34,819 observations across 13 variables

-   Data collected by the multiple Dallas shelters in 2016 and 2017

We set out to cultivate a clearer understanding of who adopts, and who gets adopted. This was achieved by examining two key questions, those being:

-   Which city council districts have the highest rate of adoption?

-   What types of animal intake tend to stay longer in shelters?

## Q1, Dallas Adopters Club: 

-   We used the variables *council_district* and *outcome_type*

    -   isolated to allow for each district to be measured against the number of animals taken into shelters whose case was resolved in adoption.

-   With a clearer picture of where adoption rates are highest, resources supporting shelter operations may be more effectively allocated

    -   Could improve outcomes for prospective adopters and the adoptees they might hope to take in.

## Dallas Adopters Club (Cont'):

Here is what we found:

```{r echo=FALSE}
#finding number of total adoptions per district in the data frame
dog_adoptions <- dog %>%
  filter(outcome_type == "ADOPTION") %>% 
  group_by(council_district) %>% 
  summarize(
    n_adoptions = n()
  )

# Now let's create the plot
ggplot(data = dog_adoptions, aes(x = council_district, y = n_adoptions)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", fill = "#99d8c9",
              color = "#00441b") +
  labs(x = "Council District", y = "Number of Adoptions") +
  ggtitle("Dog Adoptions by Council District")
```

## Dallas Adopters Club (Cont') (Cont'):

-   Adoption rates proved to be highly variable across council districts

-   Top adopting districts include 1, 4, 6, and 8

-   Lowest rates of adopting districts include 10-14

-   Geography may play a major role in pet adoption in the City of Dallas.

dallas_districts <- st_read("/Users/sydneystitt/Desktop/MATH241/project01-dog/data/Councils/Councils.shp")

```

## Q2, Those that Linger:

-   We weighed the manner of intake which animals underwent against the duration of their stay in a shelter.

    -   Constructing a measurement from the intake date to the outtake date (*dog_duration*)

    -   Charting it against *intake_type*.

-   We then generated two visualizations from which to glean trends.

## Those that Linger (Cont'):

```{r}
#Making a duration variable using dplyr
dog_duration <- dog %>%
   mutate(intake_date = mdy(intake_date),
         outcome_date = mdy(outcome_date)) %>%
  mutate(duration = difftime(outcome_date, intake_date, units = "days")) %>%
  mutate(duration = as.vector(duration))
dog_duration_summary <- dog_duration %>%
  group_by(intake_type) %>%
  summarize(average_duration = mean(duration, na.rm = TRUE),
            sd_duration = sd(duration, na.rm = TRUE),
            count_types = n()) 
print(dog_duration_summary)
```

## Those that Linger (Cont') (Cont'):

```{r, echo=FALSE}
#Graphing violin plot (all data)
ggplot(dog_duration, aes(x = intake_type, y = duration)) +
  geom_violin(fill = "#99d8c9",
              color = "#00441b") +
  theme_minimal(base_size = 8) +
  labs(x = "Intake Type", 
       y = "Duration of Stay", 
       title = "Shelter Intake Types and Durations in Dallas Animal Shelters in 2016 and 2017")
```

## Those that Linger (Cont') (Cont') (Cont'):

```{r, echo=FALSE}
#Plot
ggplot(dog_duration, aes(x = duration)) +
  geom_histogram(fill = "#99d8c9",
              color = "#00441b") +
  facet_wrap(~intake_type) +
  labs(x = "Intake Type", 
       y = "Duration of Stay", 
       title = "Shelter Intake Duration Distrib in Dallas Animal Shelters in 2016 and 2017")
```

## Those that Linger (Cont') (Cont') (Cont') (Cont'):

-   *Owner Surrender* and *Stray* were the two most common forms of intake.

-   Intake via *Foster*, *Wildlife*, *Owner Surrender*, and *Stray* correlated with the briefest tenures in shelter care

    -   Half of wildlife intakes end up euthanized, may explain their shorter stays (339/694, or 49%).

-   *Found* and *Lost Report* correlating with lengthier stays

    -   Contacting owners for lost and found animals can be a lengthy process

## Thank you for Listening

Now go out and adopt an animal, volunteer at a shelter, or just gift Adrien a shelter dog
